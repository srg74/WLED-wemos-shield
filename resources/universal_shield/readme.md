## Solder jumpers

- By default shield is preconfigured for use with digital microphone(IO14 and IO15 not shifted);
- Jumpers have to be soldered according to chosen configuration:
- IO1-IO3 - Lets you choose D2 output, GPIO1 or GPIO3;
- IO15 (ESP32 only)- Lets you choose if your output 15 is shifted or not (side marked "S" is shifted);
- IO15-1 (ESP32 only) - Must be soldered if output 15 is shifted;
- IO14 (ESP32 only) - Lets you choose if your output 14 is shifted or not (side marked "S" is shifted);
- IO14-1 (ESP32 only) - Must be soldered if  output 14 is shifted;
- J-R2 - If soldered, bypasses resistor R2;
- J-R1 - Soldered if resistor R1 must be used;
